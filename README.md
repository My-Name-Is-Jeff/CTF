## CTF

CTF (Capture the Flag), is a UHC style free for all game with no player limit.  The goal of the game is to get the most points.  Points are gained by holding the flag, so whoever holds the flag the longest wins.  

The game starts with the plugin generating a new Overworld and Nether, that do not over-right the worlds "world, world-nether, or world-end".  In both the overworld and nether, a random "structure of interest" is selected, and is set to be the game region for each dimention.  Portals built in the game regions are linked to each other, even if naturally they wouldn't go there.  Borders are also constructed around the game regions.

**Gameplay**

- 0 to 30 minutes is grace period, where players gather both custom and minecraft items
- At 30 minutes the flag drops randomly in the overworld game region (Action bar compasses appear to point to it)
- For a predetermined time, the players fight to hold the flag.  At the end of the time the player who had it the longest wins
